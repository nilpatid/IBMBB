    <div class="entry-content clearfix">
        <ol>
        <li>Dim your screen as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Set your screen to time-out quickly so that you don’t inadvertently leave it on.</li>
        <li>Use SMS instead of calling. Give instructions in your SMS to ask a friend/ family to make calls on your behalf.</li>
        <li>Switch on the phone’s Power Saving Mode or Low-Power Mode. Some operating systems even have the Ultra Power Saving Mode which is even better.</li>
        <li>Don’t set your phone to vibrate as that uses more battery-power than a ring.</li>
        <li>If your phone has haptic feedback (ie it buzzes when you type), switch that off.</li>
        <li>Switch off any automatic app updates and any app notifications</li>
        <li>Send an SMS at the top of every hour to let the&nbsp;family know your status, location AND any intentions such as attempting to move. This prevents your phone from ringing constantly&nbsp;for updates from worried loved ones.</li>
        <li>Switch off Bluetooth, Wifi and GPS (but only after you let people know exactly where you are).</li>
        <li>Only use essential apps to get updates. Limit use of video and rely on text.</li>
        <li>Disable any voice assistant such as Siri</li>
        <li>Set the phone’s volume to as low as possible (but not vibrate)</li>
        <li>Disable any visual effect/ moving backgrounds.</li>
        <li>If your phone has multiple email&nbsp;accounts – disable all except one. Now is not the time to check all your mail.</li>
        <li>Switch off any “cloud” services such as iCloud backup or Google Drive backups.</li>
        </ol>
